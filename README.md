E-Commerce Order Management System
Overview
This project is a simple implementation of an E-Commerce Order Management System using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It demonstrates how to model a domain with aggregates, entities, value objects, and repositories, as well as how to implement Event Sourcing to track and rebuild the system's state based on domain events.

Key Concepts
1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Aggregates: The main aggregate in this project is the Order aggregate, which encapsulates the order and its related items. It ensures consistency by managing the lifecycle of the entities and value objects it contains.
Entities and Value Objects: The project models essential components like Order, OrderItem, Customer, and Product.
Repositories: Repositories are used to handle data persistence, abstracting away the underlying data storage mechanism.
2. Event Sourcing
Event Sourcing: The project implements event sourcing by recording all changes to the system state as domain events. Events such as OrderCreated and OrderItemAdded are stored, allowing the system to reconstruct the current state by replaying these events.
Event Store: An EventStore class is included to persist and retrieve events associated with an aggregate.
Technologies Used
.NET Core: The project is built using .NET Core, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and modern application development practices.
C#: The primary programming language used for implementing the domain logic and infrastructure.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET Core SDK: Ensure you have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
Running the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmut-bilir/DomainDrivenDesignDemo.git
cd DomainDrivenDesignDemo
Build the Solution:

bash
dotnet build
Run the Application:

bash
dotnet run
Example Usage
After running the application, you can simulate creating an order and adding items to it using the Order aggregate. The system will log the domain events generated during these operations, and you can review the event stream in the EventStore.

Future Enhancements
CQRS Implementation: Introduce Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to separate read and write operations.
Integration with a Database: Persist events and aggregate states in a relational or NoSQL database.
User Interface: Develop a simple UI for interacting with the system.
